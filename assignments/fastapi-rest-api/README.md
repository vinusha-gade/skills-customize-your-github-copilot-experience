# 📘 Assignment: Building REST APIs with FastAPI

## 🎯 Objective

Learn how to build and test RESTful APIs using the FastAPI framework in Python. By completing this assignment, you'll understand the basics of API endpoints, request handling, and data serialization.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Task 1: FastAPI Project Setup

#### Description
Set up a new FastAPI project. Install FastAPI and Uvicorn, and create a basic application file.

#### Requirements
Completed project should:
- Include a requirements.txt with FastAPI and Uvicorn
- Have a main.py file with a minimal FastAPI app
- Run the app locally using Uvicorn

### 🛠️ Task 2: Create API Endpoints

#### Description
Add endpoints to your FastAPI app for basic CRUD operations on a resource (e.g., items, users).

#### Requirements
Completed project should:
- Implement GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE endpoints for a resource
- Use Pydantic models for request and response validation
- Return appropriate status codes and JSON responses

### 🛠️ Task 3: Test Your API

#### Description
Write simple tests to verify your API endpoints work as expected.

#### Requirements
Completed project should:
- Include example curl commands or Python test scripts
- Demonstrate successful requests and error handling
